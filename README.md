# Real-Time Chat Application with Socket.io

This assignment focuses on building a real-time chat application using Socket.io, implementing bidirectional communication between clients and server.

## Project Overview

This project is a real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.io. It allows users to join a global chat room, send and receive messages in real-time, see who is online, and interact with other users through private messages.

## Features Implemented

* **Real-time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages instantly without needing to refresh the page.
* **User Presence:** The application displays a list of online users, and notifies when a user joins or leaves the chat.
* **Private Messaging:** Users can send private messages to other users by clicking a button next to their name.
* **Typing Indicators:** The application shows when a user is typing a message.
* **Simple Authentication:** Users can join the chat by providing a username.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. **Install server dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
3. **Install client dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development servers:**
   ```bash
   # In the server directory
   npm run dev

   # In the client directory
   npm run dev
   ```
